Course in Concurrent Programming at KTH
### Homework 1 - Critical Sections, Locks, Barriers and Condition Variables with PTHREADS
Matrix was written in C and Palindrome in C++.
- [x] Matrix - Calculate sum, max and minimum values of Matrix with multiple threads.
- [x] Palindromes - Find and calculate the total amount of palindromes from a list of words (using binary search).

### Homework 1 - Critical Sections, Locks, Barriers and Condition Variables with OpenMP
Matrix was written in C and Palindrome in C++ on OSX (Mojave) with a gcc-8 compiler. 

To draw plot, cd into the directory you want to run and enter the command below in your shell:
- bash script.sh [size] 

- [x] Matrix - Calculate sum, max and minimum values of Matrix with multiple threads.
- [x] Palindromes - Find and calculate the total amount of palindromes from a list of words (using binary search).
- [x] Performance analysis - Script file that runs the programs for different sizes/amount of threads and plots them to a graph using GNUPLOT.
